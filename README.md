I had a lot of issues with this challenge. I had to restart at least 3 times. 
This is my third repo with a lot of my older code that I saved. 
Finally got it to work. My paths were just not working using the src folder. Kept getting so so many errors. 
Had to place a lot of the folders into the client folder instead. Not a very clean/organized code for me this time around.
